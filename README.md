# Ocean-Cleanup-USA

Ocean cleanup is of paramount importance to preserve marine ecosystems, protect biodiversity, and combat plastic pollution. By removing accumulated waste and debris, we can safeguard marine life, mitigate the impact on human health, and ensure a sustainable future for our planet and future generations.


Here is my interactive #tableau viz on the data from Ocean Cleanup in the US from 2015-2019.
